# IPv6 In Real Life (Generator)

This is the backend, generator part of [IPv6 In Real Life].
The website is project by [Flameeyes] to track the usefulness of an IPv6 network across a number
of different services and classes of sites.

For a background and details of what this project is about see [the launch blog post].

## Contributing

To contribute information for a new country or expand an existing country, edit or create the TOML
files inside `ipv6_in_real_life/data/`.

For each country there has to be a directory with the lowercase [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2] code, inside
which there has to be an empty `__init__.py` file.
Within these directories there should be eithre one [TOML] file per category, according to the already
existing category names for other countries, or a single TOML file per country, again following the
existing category names.
Only create a single file if there are less than 10 entries total for the country.

The format of the TOML file should follow:

```
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2077 YOUR NAME HERE

[[category name]]
main_host = "www.someservice.example"
additional_hosts = [
    "users.someservice.example",
    "login.someservice.example",
]
```

Include additional hosts that are necessary to make use of the service, for instance an user area
or the authentication host. If no additional hosts are necessary, omit the field.
